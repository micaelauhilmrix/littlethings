					<p id="p-right">Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me,
					but bear this in mind it's just meant to be.And I'm
					joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
					and it all makes sense to me.I know you've never loved
					the crinkles by your eyes when you smile you've never
					loved,your stomach or your thighs.The dimples in your back
					at the bottom of your spine but I love them endlessly. I
					won't let this little things slip out of my mouth,but if I do,
					it's you,oh it's you they add up to, I'm in love with you, and all
					these little things.</p>
